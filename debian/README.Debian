ncc for Debian
--------------
     
Since ncc-2.7-2, /usr/bin/ncc has been renamed to /usr/bin/nccgen to prevent
conflict with nemerle as identified by RC bug #407405. This is a Debian specific
change as upstream continues to keep the existing name.

Apologies to existing users of ncc for the inconvenience caused.
