Description: C source code analyzer
 A small, extensible tool that provides program analysis data of C
 source code. This data can be used to analyze the function call flow
 of programs with tools such as graphviz and springgraph. Included
 with this distribution is nccnav that can be used to study the call
 hierarchy of C source code on a text-mode console.
